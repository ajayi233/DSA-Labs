# Student Management System Testing

This directory contains test cases for the Student Management System developed in the Week 6 directory. The Student Management System provides features for managing students, courses, enrollments, and instructors, alongside implementing user authentication. The purpose of this testing suite is to ensure that all functionalities work as expected and to validate the robustness and reliability of the system.

## Testing Overview

The testing suite includes unit tests for the core functionalities of the system, ensuring that each component behaves correctly in isolation. Integration tests are also included to verify that different components of the system interact seamlessly with each other. The tests cover the following key areas:

### Student Management

- **Registration:** Tests for registering new students, ensuring validation rules are enforced (e.g., unique email and student ID).
- **Retrieval:** Tests for fetching student details, including getting all students and fetching by student ID.
- **Update:** Tests for updating student information, both self-updates and updates performed by authorized personnel.
- **Deletion:** Tests for deleting student records, ensuring proper access control.

### Course Management

- **Addition:** Tests for adding new courses, ensuring required fields are provided.
- **Retrieval:** Tests for fetching course details, including listing all courses and fetching by course ID.
- **Update:** Tests for updating course details, checking for proper authorization.
- **Deletion:** Tests for deleting courses, ensuring related data is handled correctly.

### Enrollment Management

- **Enrollment:** Tests for enrolling students in courses, including self-enrollment and enrollment by instructors.
- **Retrieval:** Tests for listing enrollments by student and by course, ensuring data integrity.
- **Deletion:** Tests for removing enrollments, checking for correct handling of associated records.

### Instructor Management

- **CRUD Operations:** Tests for managing instructor records, similar to student management tests.

### Authentication

- **Registration and Login:** Tests for user registration and login processes, enforcing security measures like password hashing.
- **Authorization:** Tests for role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain operations.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Testing Framework:** The testing suite is built using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework.
- **Supertest:** For HTTP assertions on our API endpoints.
- **Mocking:** Utilized to simulate database interactions and other external dependencies.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.
2. Execute the tests with the command `npm test`.
3. Review the test output to identify any issues or failures.

The results will provide detailed feedback on each test, helping to quickly identify and address any problems within the system.

## Conclusion

This testing suite ensures that the Student Management System operates smoothly and securely, meeting all specified requirements. By covering a wide range of scenarios and edge cases, the tests help maintain the integrity and quality of the system as it evolves.
